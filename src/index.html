<h2>
The free online recipe library for everyone
</h2>
<p>We are here to create a massive recipe library, created by our users and available to all. To achieve this goal, this
  site has a free registration process that must be completed before entering new recipes, but registration is not
  required to view anything.</p>
<br>
<p>To get started, simply use the links below to view recipes, sign up to be a member, or log in to start saving your
  favourites and adding new recipes.</p>
